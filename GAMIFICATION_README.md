## Usage

### Badge Unlocking

Badges are automatically unlocked based on user actions:

```typescript
const badges = getUnlockedBadges(
  currentStep,
  contextSummary,
  hasUploadedData,
  hasGeneratedPlan
);
```

### Progress Tracking

Calculate user progress and XP:

```typescript
const progress = calculateProgress(
  currentStep,
  contextSummary,
  hasUploadedData,
  hasGeneratedPlan,
  existingBadges,
  existingEarnedAt
);
```

### Level Progress

Get level progression information:

```typescript
const levelProgress = getLevelProgress(xp);
// Returns: { current: number, next: number, progress: number }
```

## UI Integration

### Sidebar Integration

The left sidebar shows:

- Milestone progress with phase descriptions
- Level and XP display
- Badge count

### Business Profile Integration

The right sidebar shows:

### Toast Notifications

Users receive notifications when earning new badges:

```typescript
toast({
  title: "ðŸŽ‰ Badge Earned!",
  description: `You earned the ${badgeName} badge!`,
});
```

## Data Persistence

Gamification data is persisted in localStorage via the `useChatPersistence` hook:

```typescript
interface ChatState {
  // ... existing fields
  earnedBadges: BadgeType[];
  earnedAt: Record<BadgeType, number>;
  xp: number;
  level: number;
}
```

## Privacy & Opt-in

- **Badge System**: Always active (local only)
